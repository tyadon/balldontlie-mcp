```

## Quick Start

### 1. Get API Key

Sign up at [BALLDONTLIE](https://app.balldontlie.io) to get your free API key.

### 2. Configure MCP Client

#### Option A: Use Hosted Remote Server (Recommended)

Add to your MCP client configuration (e.g., Claude Desktop) to use the hosted server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "balldontlie-api": {
      "url": "https://mcp.balldontlie.io/mcp",
      "transport": "http",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "<YOUR_BALLDONTLIE_API_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Replace `<YOUR_BALLDONTLIE_API_KEY>` with your actual API key from BALLDONTLIE.

#### Option B: Run from Source

Clone and run from source code:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/balldontlie-api/mcp-server.git
cd mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Configure your MCP client to connect to the local server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "balldontlie-api": {
      "url": "http://localhost:3000/mcp",
      "transport": "http",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "<YOUR_BALLDONTLIE_API_KEY>"
      }
    }
  }
}
```
